# Share Health Records

The shared health records functionality allows the patient to share health records linked to their ABHA address with the doctor. The reference EUA at present, provides a non-native experience to the patient, where, upon confirmation of appointment, health record sharing request is auto-triggered by the HSPA. The patient can choose any PHR application to share their health records with the doctor. 

The functionality will be updated to provide a native experience to the user and the documentation will be updated accordingly.
