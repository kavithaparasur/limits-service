# Get final prescription

The prescription sent by the doctor to the patient gets linked to their ABHA address. The user needs to be notified to check the PHR app to approve addition of the prescription to their health records.

**Note**: Current reference EUA provides a non-native (patient moves out of the EUA) experience to the patient for addition of health records. This documentation will be updated as the functionality moves to a native experience for the user. 

## UI Reference
