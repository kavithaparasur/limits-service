### The UHI Gateway on Sandbox

ABDM is operating a UHI gateway as part of its sandbox. This gateway can be used by UHI app developers to build and test their apps. 

Every Application accessing the gateway must first register itself in the UHI registry on Sandbox. The UHI gateway does not have any web interface. It merely responds to the search / on_search request from UHI applications.
